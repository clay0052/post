Let’s just say, unicode didn’t go so well. As with many projects, requirements were not well defined and people couldn’t agree on things, so the project ground to a halt. Besides unicode, for encoding special and international characters, almost all the features being discussed for PHP 6 were eventually implemented in PHP 5.3 and later, so we really didn’t miss anything else. Through it all, many things were learned and a new process for feature requests was put in place. When the feature set for a major release was accepted, it was decided, to avoid confusion with a dead project, and to skip to version 7 for the latest release.*</p>\r\n\r\n<p><small><sup>*</sup><a href=\"http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/5-new-features-php-7\" target=\"_blank\">http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/5-new-features-php-7</a></small></p>\r\n', 4),
